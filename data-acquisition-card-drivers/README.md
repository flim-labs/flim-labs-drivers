<!-- Dowload Drivers -->

## Download Drivers [(click here)](https://github.com/flim-labs/flim-labs-drivers/releases/tag/data-acquisition-card-drivers) <img src="../assets//images/shared/download-icon-black.png" width=20>

Welcome to [FLIM LABS Data Acquisition Card Drivers](https://github.com/flim-labs/flim-labs-drivers) page. In this page you can download the installer for the FLIM LABS Data Acquisition Card Drivers.

Data Acquisition Card Drivers must necessarily be installed on your PC if you want to run locally one of the following projects:

<ul style="">
    <li>
    <img src="../assets/images/shared/intensity-tracing-logo.png" width=20> 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/flim-labs/intensity-tracing-py">FLIM LABS - Intensity Tracing</a>
    </li>
       <li>
    <img src="../assets/images/shared/spectroscopy-logo.png" width=20> 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/flim-labs/spectroscopy-py">FLIM LABS - Spectroscopy</a>
    </li>
</ul>

If, however, you decide to install [Intensity Tracing](https://github.com/flim-labs/intensity-tracing-py/releases/tag/v1.4) and [Spectroscopy directly](https://github.com/flim-labs/spectroscopy-py/releases/tag/v1.0) on your PC, you will not also need to download the drivers, because their installation will be integrated during the application installation
